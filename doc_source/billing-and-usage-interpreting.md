# Interpreting your AWS bill and the AWS usage report for CloudFront<a name="billing-and-usage-interpreting"></a>

Your AWS bill for CloudFront includes codes and abbreviations that might not be immediately obvious\. The first column in the following table lists items that appear in your bill and explains what each means\.

In addition, you can get an AWS usage report for CloudFront that contains more detail than the AWS bill for CloudFront\. The second column in the table lists items that appear in the usage report and shows the correlation between bill items and usage report items\.

Most codes in both columns include a two\-letter abbreviation that indicates the location of the activity\. In the following table, *region* in a code is replaced in your AWS bill and in the usage report by one of the following two\-letter abbreviations:
+ **AP:** Hong Kong, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore \(Asia Pacific\)
+ **AU:** Australia
+ **CA:** Canada
+ **EU:** Europe and Israel
+ **IN:** India
+ **JP:** Japan
+ **ME:** Middle East
+ **SA:** South America
+ **US:** United States
+ **ZA:** South Africa

For more information about pricing by region, see [Amazon CloudFront Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/)\.

**Note**  
This table doesn't include charges for transferring your objects from an Amazon S3 bucket to CloudFront edge locations\. These charges, if any, appear in the **AWS Data Transfer** portion of your AWS bill\.
