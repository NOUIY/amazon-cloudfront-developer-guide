# Edge function logs<a name="edge-functions-logs"></a>

You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to get logs for your [edge functions](edge-functions.md), both Lambda@Edge and CloudFront Functions\. Access the logs using the CloudWatch console or the CloudWatch Logs API\.

**Important**  
We recommend that you use the logs to understand the nature of the requests for your content, not as a complete accounting of all requests\. CloudFront delivers edge function logs on a best\-effort basis\. The log entry for a particular request might be delivered long after the request was actually processed and, in rare cases, a log entry might not be delivered at all\. When a log entry is omitted from edge function logs, the number of entries in the edge function logs won't match the usage that appears in the AWS billing and usage reports\.

## Lambda@Edge logs<a name="lambda-at-edge-logs"></a>

Lambda@Edge automatically sends function logs to CloudWatch Logs, creating log streams in the AWS Regions where the functions are run\. The log group name is formatted as `/aws/lambda/us-east-1.function-name`, where *function\-name* is the name that you gave to the function when you created it, and *us\-east\-1* is the Region code for the AWS Region where the function ran\.

**Note**  
Lambda@Edge throttles logs based on the request volume and the size of logs\.

You must review CloudWatch log files in the correct AWS Region to see your Lambda@Edge function log files\. To see the Regions where your Lambda@Edge function is running, view graphs of metrics for the function in the CloudFront console\. Metrics are displayed for each AWS Region\. On the same page, you can choose a Region and then view log files for that Region to investigate issues\.

To learn more about how to use CloudWatch Logs with Lambda@Edge functions, see the following:

## CloudFront Functions logs<a name="cloudfront-function-logs"></a>

If a CloudFront function's code contains `console.log()` statements, CloudFront Functions automatically sends these log lines to CloudWatch Logs\. If there are no `console.log()` statements, nothing is sent to CloudWatch Logs\.

CloudFront Functions always creates log streams in the US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region \(`us-east-1`\), no matter which edge location ran the function\. The log group name is in the format `/aws/cloudfront/function/FunctionName`, where `FunctionName` is the name that you gave to the function when you created it\. The log stream name is in the format `YYYY/M/D/UUID`\.

The following shows an example log message sent to CloudWatch Logs\. Each line begins with an ID that uniquely identifies a CloudFront request\. The message begins with a `START` line that includes the CloudFront distribution ID, and ends with an `END` line\. Between the `START` and `END` lines are the log lines generated by `console.log()` statements in the function\.

```
U7b4hR_RaxMADupvKAvr8_m9gsGXvioUggLV5Oyq-vmAtH8HADpjhw== START DistributionID: E3E5D42GADAXZZ
U7b4hR_RaxMADupvKAvr8_m9gsGXvioUggLV5Oyq-vmAtH8HADpjhw== Example function log output
U7b4hR_RaxMADupvKAvr8_m9gsGXvioUggLV5Oyq-vmAtH8HADpjhw== END
```

**Note**  
CloudFront Functions sends logs to CloudWatch only for functions in the `LIVE` stage that run in response to production requests and responses\. When you [test a function](test-function.md), CloudFront doesn't send any logs to CloudWatch\. The test output contains information about errors, compute utilization, and function logs \(`console.log()` statements\), but this information is not sent to CloudWatch\.

CloudFront Functions uses an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) [service\-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role) to send logs to CloudWatch Logs in your account\. A service\-linked role is an IAM role that is linked directly to an AWS service\. Service\-linked roles are predefined by the service and include all of the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf\. CloudFront Functions uses a service\-linked role called **AWSServiceRoleForCloudFrontLogger**\. For more information about this role, see [Service\-linked roles for Lambda@Edge](lambda-edge-permissions.md#using-service-linked-roles) \(Lambda@Edge uses the same service\-linked role\)\.

When a function fails with a validation error or an execution error, information is logged in CloudFront's [standard logs](AccessLogs.md) and [real\-time logs](real-time-logs.md)\. Information about the error is logged in the `x-edge-result-type`, `x-edge-response-result-type`, and `x-edge-detailed-result-type` fields\.
