# Task list for serving private content<a name="private-content-task-list"></a>

To configure CloudFront to serve private content, do the following tasks:

1. \(Optional but recommended\) Require your users to access your content only through CloudFront\. The method that you use depends on whether you're using Amazon S3 or custom origins:
   + **Amazon S3** – See [Restricting access to an Amazon S3 origin](private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.md)\.
   + **Custom origin** – See [ Restricting access to files on custom origins](private-content-overview.md#forward-custom-headers-restrict-access)\.

   Custom origins include Amazon EC2, Amazon S3 buckets configured as website endpoints, Elastic Load Balancing, and your own HTTP web servers\.

1. Specify the *trusted key groups* or *trusted signers* that you want to use to create signed URLs or signed cookies\. We recommend that you use trusted key groups\. For more information, see [Specifying the signers that can create signed URLs and signed cookies](private-content-trusted-signers.md)\.

1. Write your application to respond to requests from authorized users either with signed URLs or with `Set-Cookie` headers that set signed cookies\. Follow the steps in one of the following topics: 
   + [Using signed URLs](private-content-signed-urls.md)
   + [Using signed cookies](private-content-signed-cookies.md)

   If you're not sure which method to use, see [Choosing between signed URLs and signed cookies](private-content-choosing-signed-urls-cookies.md)\.
